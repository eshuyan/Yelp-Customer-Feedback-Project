# Yelp-Customer-Feedback-Project

Motivation of the project

Customer feedback is a very important process in marketing. If you are a business owner, you always want to hear back from customers 
and improve your service and sales. Yelp has accumulated millions of customer reviews and yet has not provided the customer feedback 
service to local business. I propose to use sentiment analysis on  the yelp academic dataset which contains 2 millions reviews on 
77 thousands business over several cities and countries, and build two customer feedback products based on good and bad reviews. 
From the good reviews, I will find out all the ‘goodies’ about the business, and thus business owners could use them in their campaign 
and promotions.From the bad reviews, I will find out the short-come of the business, and provide improvement tips to business owners.

Methods

Step 1: Clean-up and select restaurant reviews from the yelp-data set (on-going).
